        COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and sending these specimens to laboratories around the UK to be tested.  If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a lab-confirmed case.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        There are separate reporting processes for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Each nation provides data based on tests carried out in NHS (and PHE) laboratories.  These represent 'pillar 1' of the Government's mass testing programme.  The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) combines the counts from the 4 nations, and adds data from tests carried out by commercial partners ('pillar 2' of the mass-testing programme) to give daily and total (cumulative) counts of lab-confirmed cases.  These are submitted to Public Health England (PHE) to display on the dashboard.  The 4 figures are not all taken from the same cut-off time: England and Scotland counts are as at 9am on the day of publication; Wales counts are as at 7am on the day of publication; Northern Ireland counts are from different times on the day of publication.  The exact time of the Northern Ireland data extract is given on the <a href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/news/covid-19-coronavirus#what-is-the-situation-in-northern-ireland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Northern Ireland Public Health Agency</a> website.

      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        The UK total is not the sum of the 4 nation totals as the pillar 2 cases cannot currently be included in the nation totals.  All other data on this website are based only on cases detected through pillar 1.  Information about the different pillars is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a>.

      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        In England, laboratories submit test results to PHE through the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).  Cases received from laboratories by 12:30am are included in the counts published that day.  Confirmed positive cases are matched to ONS geographical area codes using the home postcode of the person tested.  Postcodes are supplied by the laboratory information systems.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Duplicate tests for the same person are removed.  The first positive specimen date is used as the specimen date for that person.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Cases are aggregated to Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) and Region level and shown in the table and on the map.  UTLAs include Counties, Unitary Authorities, Metropolitan Districts and London Boroughs.  Some cases cannot be matched to a geographical area because postcode information is missing or received late.  This is why the UTLA and Region counts do not add up to the England total.  Data for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are combined because Isles of Scilly has a population of less than 10,000 and fewer than 5 cases.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Cumulative case counts include patients who are currently unwell, those have recovered and those that have died.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Total UTLA counts shown on this website can occasionally go down from one day to the next as data are revised.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Cases in people who have not been tested are not included in the confirmed case counts.

      <Styles.SectionHeader className="govuk-heading-m">Interpreting the maps</Styles.SectionHeader>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        The maps show counts of cases in each Country, Region and UTLA area.  The areas of the circles on the map are proportional to the counts.  UTLAs vary enormously in population size, from under 100,000 to over 1.4 million.  Areas with larger populations would naturally have higher numbers of cases, even if the cases were evenly distributed around the country.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        To compare the numbers of cases between areas meaningfully it is necessary to calculate rates.  These will be added to this website as soon as possible.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.SectionHeader className="govuk-heading-m">Cases over time</Styles.SectionHeader>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Daily case counts are shown in charts and tables, and can be downloaded for Regions and UTLAs as a csv file.  They are currently only available for England on this website.  Data for the rest of the UK will be included as soon as possible.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Lab-confirmed positive cases are attributed to the day the first specimen was taken from the person being tested (the specimen date).  Each day new cases are reported, but the dates they originate from cover the previous few days.  Because of this, there are few cases reported for the most recent date on the chart, but this does not mean the epidemic is tailing off.  Data from around 5 days ago can be considered complete.  Data for recent days are constantly being revised as more information becomes available.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.SectionHeader className="govuk-heading-m">Note on the change in the way the dates are attributed</Styles.SectionHeader>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Data were previously shown by reporting date. The reporting date is the date that PHE published the data, which would normally be one day after the laboratory submitted the data to PHE.  In many cases labs submit data in batches, so there may be no cases for a week and then a large number on one day.  This is not helpful for analysing the incidence of COVID-19 over time.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        The data are now shown by the date the specimen was taken from the person being tested.  This gives a much more useful analysis of the progression of cases over time.  It does mean that the latest daysâ€™ figures are always incomplete, and only data from five days or more ago can be considered complete.

        There are separate reporting processes for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  DHSC combines these 4 counts to give the overall UK daily and total (cumulative) counts.

      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        The figures currently shown for England are deaths in NHS-commissioned services of patients who have tested positively for COVID-19.  These include private provides currently providing NHS services.  Deaths are reported by the services to NHS England.  NHS England extracts data at 5pm each day and these are the basis for the death counts reported on this website the following day.  After validation, the total number of deaths in England is published by NHS England and sent to DHSC.
      </Styles.Body>
      <Styles.Body className="govuk-body">
        Deaths outside NHS services are not currently included in these counts.  Deaths of people who have tested positively for COVID-19 could in some cases be due to a different cause.
